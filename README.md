##initial investments 

## potential cashflow 
- i want this to have the potential to increase 


##  so will need 2 input boxes 

##
index1.php  - working on the php part but js might be the way to do it
index2.html - the moment .js part
index3.html - the bootstrap part - got the diff timezones working 
								 - got the npv irr to working - irr is limited as it returns Zero After so many iterations - so it will work for some datasets

## TODO 
1 - be able to handle the following values entered; 
-50000,5000,5000,5000,50000. And obviously make as dynamic as possible 
for various permutations.
